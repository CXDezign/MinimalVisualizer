# MinimalVisualizer
MinimalVisualizer is made up of smoothly connected Bezier curves to produce a responsive line soundwave visualizer for Rainmeter.
MinimalVisualizer was based on the [soundwave](https://github.com/hpgbproductions/soundwave) Rainmeter visualizer and redistributed as a standalone rebranded version.

#### Features
* Minimal, modern, and responsive design.
* Resizeable & customizable.
* Solid & Gradient line wave colour support.
* User friendly configuration.
* Automatic screen centering.

## Getting Started
In order to use the MinimalVisualizer, you must complete the following steps:
* Install [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net).
* Download the latest [MinimalVisualizer Release](https://github.com/CXDezign/MinimalVisualizer/releases).
* Open the **MinimalVisualizer.rmskin** skin package through Rainmeter.

## Customisation
Customisation of the visualizer is supported. Right click on the skin and select the **MinimalVisualizer - Edit** option.
Customisation variables are stored in the **MinimalVisualizer\@Resources\Variables.inc** file.

### Customisation Warning
Any customisation beyond this file may potentially break the visualizer, edit at your own risk!

### Visualizer Position
* If you would like to reposition your visualizer to a different location, use the X,Y coordinates through Rainmeter to do so as editing the X,Y coordinates through the code may produce unwanted results.
